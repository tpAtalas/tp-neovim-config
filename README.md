> [Neovim](https://neovim.io/charter/) is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the
> tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a
> continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very
> clever but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and
> more.
